## About The Project
"MathWorld" is the working title of an educational math game. (Note: Most of the information to follow can also be found in the form of a [mindmap](https://www.creaza.com/sindre-heggen/uprbEC56rv))

## Built With
* [Godot 4 (GDScript, static typed)](https://godotengine.org/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)

## Contributing
The project is (hopefully) structured in a way that invites others to expand the number of languages offered.
* The "vid-" folders contains the folders "text" and "audio".
* In "text" you will find .asy files named "frameX_languageabbrv.". Copy the respective files for one of the languages present, and edit them into your
language. It is not necessary to compile the files, so a text editor is suffient.
* In "audio" you can add your .mp3-files for each frame.

## Outline
### Story
Some creatures, let's call them
mathlings, arrive at an empty planet, and
have to discover the basics of math by themselves. The mathlings does not have any spoken language, hence they must discover the math by finding the patterns and relations (as opposed to reading information).

### Map
The planet starts off containing
landscape only, but as the mathlings
make their mathematical discoveries,
they will be able to build roads, buildings, etc. Different topics of math will define different parts of the landscape. By completing mini games of a topic, the mathlings get access to new type of buildings and new topics.
