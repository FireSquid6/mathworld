## About The Project
"MathWorld" is the working title of an educational math game. At the moment, the project consists of 'video room' presenting videos on selected methods for elementary calculations. You can check out the movie room on [itch.io](https://sindrsh.itch.io/videoroom).

## Built With
* [Godot (GDScript)](https://godotengine.org/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)

## Contributing
The project is (hopefully) structured in a way that invites others to expand the number of languages offered.
* The "vid-" folders contains the folders "text" and "audio". 
* In "text" you will find .asy files named "frameX_languageabbrv.". Copy the respective files for one of the languages present, and edit them into your 
language. It is not necessary to compile the files, so a text editor is suffient.
* In "audio" you can add your .mp3-files for each frame.

## Outline 
Some aliens, let's call them mathlings, land with their spaceship on an unpopulated planet.
The only equipment they have brought is a math library (including the videoroom).
They start building their world by playing math related minigames, giving them resources.
When topics of math are successfully completed, new territory can be discovered.
There will be farms where the mathlings can harvest by performing elementary calculations. This to
enhance practice on topics where a lot of repetiotion is needed both to learn and preserve the skills.
