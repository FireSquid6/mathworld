## Contributing
The project is (hopefully) strucured in a way that invites others to expand the number of languages offered.
The "vid-" folders contains the folders "text" and "audio". In "text" you will find .asy files named "frameX_languageabbrv.". Copy the respective files for one of the languages present, and edit them into your 
language. It is not necessary to compile the files, so a text editor is suffient.
