## About The Project
"MathWorld" is the working title of an educational math game. (Note: Most of the information to follow can also be found in the form of a [mindmap](https://www.creaza.com/sindre-heggen/uprbEC56rv))

## Main objective
A low-price (< 2$) game
for learning
elementary math. Getting a playable version available
is prioritized over making a "perfect" version. Shall be playable on computers and tablets.

## Built With
* [Godot 4 (GDScript, static typed)](https://godotengine.org/)
* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [Asymptote](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/)

## Roadmap
(Check the Issues tab for more specific tasks)
* Making minigames </br>
Other than running from source, the minigames can be cheked out at [itch.io](https://sindrsh.itch.io/mathworld)
* Writing a more complete story about the mathlings
* Completing the first part of the MathWorld; the "Counting" part.

## Outline
### Story
Some creatures, let's call them
mathlings, arrive at an empty planet, and
have to discover the basics of math by themselves. The mathlings does not have any spoken language, hence they must discover the math by finding patterns and relations (as opposed to reading information).

### Map
The planet starts off containing
landscape only, but as the mathlings
make their mathematical discoveries,
their world gain roads and buildings. Different topics of math will define different parts of the landscape. By completing minigames of a topic, the mathlings get access to new type of buildings and new topics.

### Topics
Most topics will be focusing on three types of skills:
- Calculation
- Numbers as amounts
- Numbers as placements on a line
(The topics and skills are founded on the theory covered in [this book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dYgNJhAPwST242vCtwdEP69xmgybLYXT/view?usp=share_link))

The topics are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, factorization, order of operations, negative numbers, geometry, algebra (in the form of letter calculation), equations, and functions
